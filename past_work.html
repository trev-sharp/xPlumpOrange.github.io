              <h3>Personal Website | Responsive Website</h3>
              <p>This is my first ever public website, I made with it basic HTML and CSS. Currently, you are on it!</p>

              <h3>AdvancedIP | Plugin</h3>
              <p>This is one of my more recent plugins, and one of my personal favorites. It helps servers track and log players' IP history and geolocations related to the IPs. This plugin is "semi-open source," meaning the basic framework of the plugin is shown, but no actual usable code is given.</p>

              <h3>Combo Grabber | Java Application</h3>
              <p>This is an open source Pastebin email:password combo grabber. Uses various HTML skimmers to grab Google search results and raw text data from Pastebin, then automatically deciphers the data and displays it on a custom made GUI. This is a very useful application for account miners.</p>

              <h3>Artficial Intelligence API | Java API</h3>
              <p>This is my first open source API for Java. This API offers 2 neural netowork objects, a 3 layer and a 5 layer network. It uses the feed foward method and uses back propagation to train. In all honesty, it's a little janky with its hard to understand format and no detailed documentation.</p>

              <h3>Trivia Game Helper | Java Application</h3>
              <p>This is an open source application that helps answer multiple choice questions. (Originally made for HQTrivia) It uses HTML skimmers to grab Google and Yahoo search results, then uses many layers of checking to find the most likely answer to the question. I even had the audacity to have multi-language support. My all time favorite project.</p>

              <h3>OrangeBot | Java Discord Bot</h3>
              <p>This is an open source discord bot made in Java. Offers a template for commands, events, etc.. Came with many pre-built commands such as "help," "8ball," "announce," and a few others. This used to be my personal bot for my discord server until I discontinued my discord server.</p>

              <h3>Giveaway Plugin | Plugin</h3>
              <p>This was the first ever project I had posted to Github. This was one of my first "big" plugins, big as in time consuming. As I look back on this plugin, I think about how I have came a long way from when I first started making plugins. FYI, this was before I completely understood OOP and the whole plugin was a single class :/.</p>
