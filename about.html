			My online username/brand is PlumpOrange and I'm a freelance Java developer. I have been coding since the age of 8, making basic website designs with HTML and CSS. Over the years, when I was younger, I experimented with many coding languages, trying things like Flash, C++, and C#. I eventually settled on the coding language Java, 3 years ago. My motivation to start Java programming was Minecraft plugin development, I was fascinated with minigames, anti-cheats, and cosmetic type plugins, among other things. When I started Java however, I didn't get into plugin development, I started by making little games. The first game I made was a game I called "Asteroids." It was a text-based game with '-' representing the playing field, 'o' representing the character, and 'x' representing the asteroids. In this game you would run around dodging asteroids coming down on the field, leaving obstacles in the way that you couldn't walk over. I was really happy with myself after making that game, leading myself to make many other little games here and there. At the time, I wasn't that serious about coding, I slacked and didn't practice much at all. After a year I finally motivated myself to get serious about my passion, so I began watching youtube videos on bukkit plugin development and started making little plugins. Eventually I got to the point where I was comfortable enough to start coming up with my own ideas. One of the earliest plugins I came up with, that I can remember, was a plugin I called Personal Worlds. It was basically a backbone for a whole server game mode. In it players created their own survival worlds, allowing the player to change difficulty, seed, and even game mode. It had a full GUI and aloud support for many configurations. Things like world border, player limit, etc. could be changed backend through a config. This project was a very ambitious one, and development last over a month by myself. In the end, it turned out great, and I gave it to a small server to use and test for me. Sadly though, that server quickly shut down and I gave up on the project, eventually losing the project itself. I also have to admit that, while at the time I didn't care, I had made the whole plugin in a single class. (What a pleb I was) After that I kept pushing myself to make big projects, getting other developers to help me with my struggles and bugs, I was eventually able to code cooler things. Like a schematic printer that placed the blocks with cool animations and sounds, Artificial Intelligence API's, and an intelligent question answerer, getting 80% of the questions right. While I still find myself struggling on certain things and lacking in some departments, I can say at least that I've come a long way from the beginning and learned many skills on the way.
